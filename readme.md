# Project Title

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of population data and the identification of potential locations for a new shop for the Martinus bookstore chain in Slovakia.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

- **Importing Necessary Libraries:** Code for importing required Python libraries.

- **Verifying GPS Coordinates:** Implementation of a function to verify the equality of GPS coordinates.

- **Loading and Exploring Data:** Loading and exploring a dataset containing information about municipalities in Slovakia. The data is sourced from [Scitanie.sk](https://www.scitanie.sk/obyvatelia/zakladne-vysledky/pocet-obyvatelov/SR/SK0/OB).

- **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocessing steps including column selection and renaming.

- **Web Scraping Information about Martinus Shops:** Scraping information about Martinus shops from their website.

- **Displaying Martinus Shop Addresses:** Displaying and cleaning Martinus shop addresses.

- **Geocoding Martinus Shop Addresses:** Obtaining GPS coordinates for Martinus shop addresses.

- **Mapping Martinus Shops:** Creating a map to visualize Martinus shop locations.

- **Analyzing Population with Martinus Shops:** Analyzing the population of cities with Martinus shops.

- **Finding Potential Shop Locations:** Identifying potential shop locations based on population and distance.

- **Final Decision on Shop Location:** Making a final decision on the optimal shop location.

- **Additional Considerations:** Considerations for further project enhancements.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Run the Jupyter notebook

## Additional Notes

- The project explores population data, sourced from [Scitanie.sk](https://www.scitanie.sk/obyvatelia/zakladne-vysledky/pocet-obyvatelov/SR/SK0/OB), and aims to provide insights into optimal shop locations for the Martinus bookstore chain in Slovakia.

- Further improvements and considerations, such as GDP, profit analysis, and accessibility, can be explored.

## Disclaimer 
-The Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files on GitHub may not render interactive maps. To view the interactive maps, it is recommended to run the notebook locally. In case the maps are not interactive, screenshots have been provided to offer a visual representation of the results.
